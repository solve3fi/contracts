## What this program is

A concentrated-liquidity AMM (a Whirlpool-style CLMM): liquidity providers choose price ranges, pools have fee
tiers and tick spacing, positions are NFTs, and rewards can be emitted to in-range liquidity. The core maths, tick
arrays, swap engine, position bundles, Token-2022 support and two-hop swaps are Orca's, unchanged apart from renaming
(`Whirlpool` becomes `Solve`) and the toolchain port described below.

## What Solve3 added

| Addition | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Gauge emissions (`set_gauge_emissions`, `burn_unearned_gauge_emissions`) | The Solve3 governance program (`vesolve`) funds a pool's reward slot with SOLV3 emissions chosen by veSOLV3 votes. Only the governance PDA may manage a gauge reward. |
| Activity gate (`state/gate.rs`) | A pool earns gauge emissions in an hour only if the previous hour showed enough fee yield. It is a pool-wide switch; it never scales an individual position. State lives in 32 bytes of the pool account. |
| Trading pauses (`set_trading_pauses`) | Admin switches that stop swaps and new liquidity independently. Removing liquidity, collecting fees and closing positions are never paused. |
| Default protocol-fee cap | The default protocol fee rate for new pools is capped at 8,000 of 10,000 basis points. |
| Branding and metadata | SOLV3 position NFT names, symbols and metadata URIs, memo text and `security.txt`. |
| `fast-epochs` build feature | Test-only build with shortened time buckets for devnet rehearsals. |
| Toolchain port | Anchor 0.32.1, Solana crates 2.x. |

## Relationship to the other Solve3 repositories

- The governance program (`vesolve`: vote-escrow locks, voting, bribes, native gauges, exit fee) and the SOLV3 token
  program live in the `ve33-contracts` repository. `vesolve` calls this program through Anchor CPI.
- The web app, indexer and quest backend are in the Solve3 frontend repository.

## Building

Requires the Rust toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` and the Anchor CLI.

```sh
anchor build                             # default build
anchor build -- --features fast-epochs   # devnet rehearsal build
```
